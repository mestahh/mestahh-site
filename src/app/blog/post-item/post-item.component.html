        <p>Well, this is my site now. My main goal is to create an Angular website.</p>

        <p>Technical specifications are for now: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The whole site is served by AWS, totally serverless</li>
          <li>Everything is stored in DynamoDB</li>
          <li>API Gateway serves as the REST API behind the Angular site</li>
          <li>All functions are AWS lambdas</li>
          <li>User authentication is handled by AWS Cognito</li>
          <li>Google analytics is set up properly</li>
          <li>Everything should be stored on S3</li>
          <li>There should be an AWS automated deployment pipeline for Continuous delivery</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Feature specifications:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy what soundcloud can do in terms of upload, playback, organizing into albums, playlists, etc.</li>
          <li>I should be able to post an article to the blog, edit, delete, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Currently, I have the basic Angular app set up, I have some bootstrap styling and everything is uploaded to AWS
          S3, where it is served by a webserver (on S3 itself). In the Angular app, I have a couple Components at the moment only and
          they are not doing much. They basically just bind the HTML templates together.
          I have CloudFront set up there, so my site is replicated in
          every region, so it will be really fast. I bought a domain (<a href="http://mestahh.net" target="_blank">http://mestahh.net</a>) and that is bound in Route53 in AWS to
          serve the S3 content, which is this site. This is an extremely cool journey. I can't wait to have some real working content here.
        </p>
        <p>I have created a small git repository where I uploaded the angular application.
          I will create at least two more, one for the lambdas and another one for the CloudFormation scripts that will
          make the deployment possible. Here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/mestahh/mestahh-site" target="_blank">https://github.com/mestahh/mestahh-site</a>
